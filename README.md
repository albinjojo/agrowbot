# Agrowbot

Lightweight retrieval-augmented QA helper for rice pest control guidance using FAISS and OpenAI chat completions.

## Features
- Builds embeddings from local PDF references with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and stores them in FAISS.
- Serves concise, context-grounded answers via OpenAI chat completions.
- Robust voice interaction loop for interactive questioning.

## Project structure
- agri.index, chunks.pkl: FAISS index and serialized text chunks generated by `index.py`.
- index.py: PDF ingestion, chunking (500-word windows), embedding, and index build script.
- app.py: Runtime retrieval and Q&A loop backed by OpenAI with per-session chat memory.
- requirements.txt: Python dependencies.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ recommended.
- OpenAI API key (set as `OPENAI_API_KEY`). Optional `OPENAI_MODEL` overrides the default model.
- Source PDFs placed alongside the scripts (filenames in `index.py`).

## Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

## Build the index
Run after placing the PDF files listed in `index.py` in the project root:
```bash
python index.py
```
Artifacts produced:
- agri.index (FAISS index)
- chunks.pkl (serialized text chunks)

## Run the Q&A loop
```bash
python app.py
```
Type a question; enter `exit` or press Enter on an empty line to quit.

## Notes
- Responses strip asterisks and return 2-3 concise bullet phrases when context is available.
- If the question is off-topic, the app replies with: I am sorry, I don't have the information to answer that question.
- Retrieval uses top-3 chunks; adjust `k` in `retrieve()` if you need more or fewer.
